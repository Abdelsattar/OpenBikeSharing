{"name":"OpenBikeSharing","tagline":"Display shared bikes availability in your city","body":"OpenBikeSharing\r\n===============\r\n\r\nOpenBikeSharing is an Android application that displays the availability of shared bikes in your\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIt uses the [CityBikes API](http://api.citybik.es/v2/) that provides data for more than 170 cities\r\n(in 19 countries) and displays those data on an [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) layer\r\nthanks to the [osmdroid](https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid) library (you can choose between\r\nmultiple layers).\r\n\r\nDownload\r\n--------\r\n\r\nOpenBikeSharing is available on\r\n[F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=be.brunoparmentier.openbikesharing.app) and\r\n[Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=be.brunoparmentier.openbikesharing.app).\r\nSigned APK's can also be found on GitHub in the\r\n[Releases](https://github.com/bparmentier/OpenBikeSharing/releases) section.\r\n\r\nContribute\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is my first Android application. I probably don't comply with all the \"good practices\" and the\r\ncode may be a bit messy. So if you have enough courage, take a look at it and tell me what is wrong!\r\n\r\nIf your language is not supported yet, I will gladly add it if you translate some strings for me.\r\nThey are located in `app/src/main/res/values-xx` (there is not much).\r\n\r\nAs I don't have as many devices as I would like to test this app on (only one, actually), please\r\nreport any bug/crash that you may encounter. And feel free to make any suggestions to improve it.\r\n\r\nBuild\r\n-----\r\n\r\nIf you use Android Studio, you can import the project directly from GitHub.\r\n\r\nOtherwise you can build it from the command line with\r\n[Gradle](https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio-build.html).  \r\nClone the repo and type:\r\n\r\n    ./gradlew build\r\n\r\n(You may need to `chmod +x` the `gradlew` script)\r\n\r\nIf the build fails, try to add the following to `app/build.gradle`:\r\n\r\n    android {\r\n        â€¦\r\n        lintOptions {\r\n            abortOnError false\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n\r\nThe Gradle script will take care of downloading the necessary libraries and will generate the APK's\r\nin `app/build/outputs/apk`.\r\n\r\nPermissions\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nThe following permissions are needed by OpenBikeSharing (those are the same that are required by\r\nosmdroid):\r\n\r\n* ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION\r\n* ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION\r\n* ACCESS_WIFI_STATE\r\n* ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE\r\n* INTERNET\r\n* WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE\r\n\r\nInternet access is needed to download the map tiles and the stations. Location access is only used\r\nto locate you on the map. Access to the SD card is required by osmdroid to cache the tiles.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
