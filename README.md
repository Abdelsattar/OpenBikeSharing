OpenBikeSharing
===============

OpenBikeSharing is an Android application that displays the availability of shared bikes in your city in real time.

It uses the CityBikes API (http://api.citybik.es/v2/) that provides data for more than 170 cities and displays those data on an OpenStreetMap layer thanks to the osmdroid library (https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid).
