title: I don't have/want neither Google Play nor F-Droid. Where can I get an APK?
description: |
    <p>OpenBikeSharing APK's are hosted on GitHub in the
    <a href="https://github.com/bparmentier/OpenBikeSharing/releases">
    Releases</a> section.</p>
    <p>They are signed with the developer's key and are the
    same as those distributed through Google Play.</p>
