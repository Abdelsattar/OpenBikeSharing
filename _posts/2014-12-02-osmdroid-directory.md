title: There is a 100+ MiB "osmdroid" directory on my SD card. Can I delete it?
description: |
    <p><a href="https://github.com/osmdroid/osmdroid">osmdroid</a> is a library
    used by OpenBikeSharing to display the maps. The
    tiles are downloaded and stored on your SD card the first time you browse
    the map to reduce bandwith later.</p>
    <p>You can safely delete this directory, but the tiles will be downloaded
    again the next time you browse the map.</p>
